<p>
I am a Computer Systems Engineer working as a Freelancer since 2017. I've been working remotely with small business around US, Europe and South America, Delivering reliable solutions to what they need. 

Since i've always worked remote, i'm a very organized, autonomous and self motivated person to accomplish my tasks, specially because im passionate about creating practical solutions through designing useful interfaces and coding. Also I had to develop a lot of skills related to sales, customer service, business management, digital marketing and more.

Since I am a coder my favourites technologies are Wordpress, Laravel and its JS cousin Adonis; Gatsby, and React and Vue (these pair do the same but I love front end). For a full list of technologies I know you should visit my <a href="https://www.samuelriverac.com/">portfolio</a> :)

When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning, training at the gym <s> Damn you COVID lol </s>, learning languages, watching anime, playing videogames or worldbuilding my power fantasies ðŸ˜‚.
