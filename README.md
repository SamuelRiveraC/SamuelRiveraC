Hi, I'm a Software Engineer, and I've been working remotely with businesses across the US and Spain since 2017. I focus on creating simple, user-friendly solutions through design and code. I believe tech should be intuitive and reliable, which is why I love working with different technologies like WordPress, Laravel, Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind, etc.

Before diving into any problem, I think about the best solution so I can deliver quality results from the start with minimal effort. I value trust and autonomy in my work, and I enjoy being in environments where I can take ownership and bring value to the table without unnecessary complexity.

Though I'm currently working in an office, I know the power of flexibility. Remote work has always given me the freedom to stay focused on my professional goals while balancing personal passions. Outside of work, you can find me learning, exploring new languages, or working out, all while keeping an eye on my next project... even if my next project is to finish my world conquest in a videogame LOL or planning a wonderful trip with my lovely Wife :)

If you're looking for someone whoâ€™s committed to creating practical, simple, and effective solutions, let's connect!
