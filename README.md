# 🔴 Hi! Samuel here!
It is always said, show don't tell. But while I like a good story, less is more, so I am here to tell you I am a straightforward and self-reliant guy, who thinks before acting, so when i do, i end up creating the efficient and robust high impact solution. 

I'm a Software Engineer, and I've been working remotely with businesses across the US and Spain since 2017. I focus on creating simple, user-friendly solutions through design and code. I believe tech should be intuitive and reliable, so I love working with different technologies like WordPress, Laravel, Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind, etc.

But I also have experience in different areas such as business portals, job boards, real estate, healthcare, inmigration law (and im a migrant too!), and a little Data Scraping there and there. So Building web applications with the best practices and clean coding is my passion. as I told you! less is more.

## 🏆 About me
Living in 🇪🇸. I'm currently working in an office, I know the power of flexibility. Remote work has always given me the freedom to stay focused on my professional goals while balancing personal passions. Outside of work, you can find me learning, exploring new languages, or working out, all while keeping an eye on my next project... even if my next project is to finish my world conquest in a videogame LOL or planning a wonderful trip with my lovely Wife 💞 :)
